the structure should work for 64x64 images by updating the root folder of the dataloader.

Using the determinitic warmups and L1 loss, BetaL1.py illustrates the architecture of the VAE model:

The model is trained by minimizing a loss that balances reconstruction accuracy (how well the output matches the input) and KL divergence (ensuring the latent space resembles a standard normal distribution), enabling both data reconstruction and generation of new samples.
